## Project Overview

The UNILINK: Academic Community Web Application is an interactive, web-based platform designed specifically for academic institutions. Its primary goal is to enhance the management of student information, streamline course scheduling, and facilitate accurate grade viewing. Acting as a comprehensive Student Information System (SIS), UNILINK unites essential academic management tasks into a single, integrated platform.

This system offers significant improvements in operational efficiency, allowing administrative staff to reduce manual tasks and focus on core academic responsibilities. For students, it ensures accessibility and transparency in accessing academic records, schedules, and performance updates. The platform is built with a user-friendly interface, making it easy for students to interact with the system and stay informed about their academic progress.
